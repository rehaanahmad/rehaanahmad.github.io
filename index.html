											<h2>Rehaan Ahmad</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hey! My name is Rehaan Ahmad. I'm a student at Cupertino High School and a machine learning research intern at INRIA. I typically work on the crossroads between remote sensing (specifically, satellite vegetation analysis) and machine learning. However, I have found myself working on projects as far out as quantum computing--in fact, I'm currently exploring topics within the realm of Universal Gate Quantum Computing. The underlying motivation for a lot of my work stems from the old Ben Franklin axiom "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"--a rule that reigns especially true when it comes to problems such as malware detection and famine prevention.</p>

										<h3>Machine Learning Research with the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) </h3>
										<p>Working with Senior Researcher Gerardo Rubino, along with 3 other CS researchers, on a graph neural network (GNN) approach to forecasting vegetation. Unlike existing algorithms, this GNN approach has the potential to forecast specific types of vegetation over larger regions. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<img src="images/fing.png" alt="" width = "100"/>
										<h3>Machine Learning Team Lead &amp; First Author with the Faculty of Engineering, University of the Republic, Uruguay</h3>
										<p>Worked with Professor Pablo Rodriguez-Bocca and a team of other computer scientists and agronomists (agricultural experts based at the Uruguayan National Institute for Agriculture & Livestock) on a ConvLSTM approach to forecasting vegetation. Due to the memory-intensive networks, computational resources were provided by Uruguay's National Center for Supercomputing (cluster.uy).</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<img src="images/dwave2.png" alt="" width = "300"/>
										<h3>Quantum Computing Research with D-Wave</h3>
										<p>With the guidance of Dr. Joel Gottlieb (a physicist at D-Wave), I worked on research related to the detection of heap-spraying malware attacks on computers. I was granted 10 months of quantum computing time by D-Wave (value at $2000/month), and was one of the handful of researchers given access to the state-of-the-art, 15 million dollar 2000Q quantum computer before it was released to the public. </p>
									</li>

										<img src="images/sciencefair.jpg" alt="" width = "120"/>
										<h3>Science Fairs</h3>
										<p>Participated in a variety of science fairs from the Google Science Fair to the California State Science Fair. Science fairs have been an important way for me to explore new avenues and have typically stemmed into larger research projects later on. Awards detailed below.</p>

										<h3>Competitions Mentor @ Cupertino High School STEM Club</h3>
										<p>Mentored over 40 students for the Synopsys science fair (have collectively won 16 awards at the fair). In addition to hosting workshops and weekly Monday meetings, I work 1-on-1 with students and help them with everything from solving technical problems to sharpening presentation skills.</p>
									</li>
									
								        <li>
										<img src="images/maa.png" alt="" width = "200"/>

									</li>
									<li>
										<img src="images/drones4.png" alt="" width = "150"/>
										<h3>Orange Orchard Analysis Research</h3>
										<p>Designed autonomous drone control software to have a drone navigate an orange orchard and photograph each individual tree. Also worked on an algorithm to process each drone-image and identify the number of abnormal oranges. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<img src="images/cupertino-logo.png" alt="" width = "100"/>
										<h3>Public Forum Debate @ Cupertino High School</h3>

                                    <li>
										<img src="images/math.png" alt="" width = "100"/>
										<h3>Mathematics Teaching</h3>
										<p>Taught math to two groups of 15 students at the San Jose Bascom and Joyce libraries. Focused on developing problem-solving skills and cultivating an interest in mathematics. </p>
									</li>
                                    <li>
										<img src="images/mathcounts.jpg" alt="" width = "100"/>
										<h3>MathCounts Coaching</h3>
										<p>Coached a middle school MathCounts team of 25 students. Focused on sharpening problem-solving abilities and teaching new mathematical concepts to the students.</p>
